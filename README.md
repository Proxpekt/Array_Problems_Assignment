## Array Problems

1. Reverse an Array

2. Find the Maximum and Minimum Element in an Array

3. Find the Sum of Elements in an Array

4. Find the Second Largest Element in an Array

5. Count Frequency of Elements in an Array

6. Check if an Array is Sorted

7. Rotate Array by `k` Positions (Right Rotation)

8. Find a Pair with a Given Sum

9. Remove Duplicates from an Array (Maintain Order)

10. Merge Two Sorted Arrays

11. Remove a Given Element from an Array

12. Find the Missing Number  
   (Array of size `n` containing numbers from `1` to `n` with one missing)

13. Find Duplicate Elements in an Array

14. Find Intersection of Two Arrays

15. Find Union of Two Arrays

16. Check if Two Arrays Are Equal  
   (Both arrays contain the same elements)

17. Find the Leader Elements in an Array  
   (An element is a leader if it is greater than all elements to its right)

18. Move All Zeroes to the End of the Array  
   (Maintain the order of non-zero elements)

19. Find Subarray with a Given Sum

20. Rotate Array to the Left by `k` Positions

21. Find the Kth Smallest Element in an Array

22. Find All Subarrays of an Array

23. Maximum Sum Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)

24. Rearrange Array Alternately  
   (Largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, …)

25. Find the Majority Element  
   (Element appearing more than `n/2` times)

26. Find a Peak Element  
   (An element greater than its neighbors)

27. Find the First Missing Positive Integer

28. Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s

29. Find the Longest Consecutive Sequence

30. Product of Array Except Self  
   Given an array, return a new array where each element is the product of all elements except itself (without using division).  
   **Example:**  
   Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`  
   Output: `[24, 12, 8, 6]`

31. Find Equilibrium Index  
   (Sum of elements on left = sum of elements on right)

32. Find Maximum Product Pair in an Array

33. Find Maximum Difference  
   (`j > i` such that `arr[j] - arr[i]` is maximum)

📌 **Note:**  
All problems are to be solved using efficient algorithms and proper edge-case handling.
